# 👋 About Me

I’m a **Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE)** student at Howest (Belgium),
specializing in **C++ game programming** with a focus on **game engine architecture and clean systems**.

I enjoy breaking complex problems into reusable libraries and building solid foundations that future games can rely on.

> 🦍 **Fun fact:** I was born on **September 8, 1992** —  
> the same day *Donkey Kong Country* launched in Japan.  
> It’s also **World Great Ape Day**, and my Chinese Zodiac sign is **Monkey**.

Some call that coincidence.  
I call it good instincts: I like my branches clean and my code structured.

## 🤖 AI & Workflow Philosophy

I hail from the pre-AI era — back when code was carved into stone tablets and bugs were hunted through the tall grass with nothing but a stick and a grimace.
Then I discovered the force. Not the boring, movie kind — the real one. The kind that flows through the jungle canopy, humming with raw power, tempting you with speed and convenience. I trained with it. I prompted with purpose. I wielded it like a lightsaber carved from the purest banana crystal.

But the Dark Side is sly. My hands-on skills began to slip. I faced my ancient nemesis — the cursed for loop — and fumbled like a chimp trying to rewire a coconut. The knowledge was still there, buried deep in the vines, but the muscle memory had started to fade.

From my treetop perch, I saw it everywhere — young padawans, swinging fearlessly while their AI vine was strong… but plummeting the moment it was cut. I was different — but not for much longer. My mastery of the Code Force was growing, but my ability to simply type was slipping into the undergrowth.

This could not stand.

I turned from the Dark Side. I forged the Way of the Balanced Ape. Autocomplete was banished from my jungle. AI was forbidden from handing me ready-made code. Its role was stripped to a single, humble task: save me the endless hours I’d waste wandering through the sacred halls of cppreference and the forsaken ruins of Stack Overflow.

I code in two modes:  
**Mastery mode** — Autocomplete off, hints only, code snippets as if you'd find it in the sacred cppreference scrolls, I do the work. This keeps my ape-grip strong and my reflexes sharp.  
**Beast mode** — Autocomplete on, sabers swinging, tearing through jams, competitions, and delivery sprints faster than a rhino on a banana run.

## 🧭 Connected Worlds

My creations roam freely across multiple domains — each one a branch of the same jungle:

🕹️ [itch.io](https://bvisi0n.itch.io) — Game jam entries, playable builds, and prototypes  
🎧 [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Bvis10n) — Public archive of original music and SFX from jams and projects  
💻 [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/Bvisi0n) — Math tricks, systems glue, and bite-sized tools
