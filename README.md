# 👋 About Me

I'm a student at **Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE)** in Howest, Belgium —
specializing in **C++ game development** and **animation mathematics**.

I’m rebuilding my technical foundation after a break, combining prior training, work experience, and self-study into a focused dev journey.
No job-hunting here — just documenting the process and enjoying the ride. *(Although I will accept code reviews and ripe bananas.)*

> 🍌 **Fun fact:** I was born on **September 8, 1992** —  
> the same day *Donkey Kong Country* launched in Japan.  
> It’s also **World Great Ape Day**, and yes, my Chinese Zodiac sign is **Monkey**.

Some say that’s coincidence.  
I say it’s destiny. 🦍  
Call me **Mr. Ape** — I build libraries, not banana piles.

## 🧠 Background Timeline

* 📚 **2015–2016** — Software & Web Dev (VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, Java, SQL, UML)
* 🎮 **2019–2020** — First run at DAE (quit due to Covid ruining on-campus experience)
* 🛍️ **2018–2023** — Retail worker @ Kringloopwinkel Beveren-Leie
* 🔌 **2023–2025** — Telecom technician @ Telenet (HFC networks, routing, Wi-Fi, IP config)
* 🎓 **2025–Now** — Back at DAE — focused, determined, and not starting from zero

## 🎮 Game Dev Focus

**Current learning focus:**

* Modern C++ (C++17/20), clean architecture, TDD
* Animation math (vectors, matrices, transforms, kinematics)
* Game systems thinking & reusability
* Low-level engine-friendly code (less Unity spaghetti, more C++ al dente)

**Side tools:**

* Blender (hard surface modeling, UV unwrapping, basic texturing)
* GitHub Copilot & ChatGPT (code assistant, not autopilot)
* Markdown, Doxygen, Catch2
* Audio hobbyist: FL Studio + NI Komplete 14 CE *(beats optional, drums not required)*

## 📌 Guiding Principles

* ✅ Clean, testable code > quick hacks
* 📚 Clear documentation > assumptions
* 🧩 Systems > scripts
* 🧠 Understanding > memorization
* 🤖 AI-assisted, not AI-dependent
* 🚫 I don’t ship vibes, I ship working code
* 🦍 Strong typing, strong builds, strong branches

## 🤖 AI & Workflow Philosophy

I hail from the pre-AI era — when troubleshooting meant burning hours stepping through breakpoints, manually reviewing UML on paper, and combing through Stack Overflow or cppreference to find that one obscure rule. Every function, every doc comment, every test — handwritten. Slowly.

Then Copilot and ChatGPT arrived. It was a shock.

Suddenly, I could generate test cases for edge behavior, structure Doxygen comments in my own house style, and even draft safe refactors — all in seconds. What used to be overhead is now velocity.

I don't use AI to avoid thinking. I use it to **think better, faster, and more structurally**.

In today’s landscape, using AI tools **isn’t cheating — it's how you stay relevant**.
If you know how to prompt, validate, and adapt, it becomes a creative partner.
But like any partner, it needs review.

> **AI doesn't replace expertise. It amplifies it — or exposes the lack of it.**
> *I used to sweat for hours to find the bug.
> Now I sweat for seconds — to make sure Copilot isn’t lying to me.*

## 🧪 Bonus Gist Workflow

Some of my snippets and utility functions live temporarily as GitHub Gists.
They're like camping out until they earn a permanent home in my libraries.

Check my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/Bvisi0n) for experiments, early drafts, or code that escaped before I could put a license on it.

Thanks for visiting my corner of GitHub!  
You may now resume scrolling the void — but remember: **real devs swing through branches, not burn them.**
