# 👋 About Me

I'm a student at **Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE)** in Howest, Belgium —  
specializing in **C++ game development** and **animation mathematics**.

I’m rebuilding my technical foundation after a break, combining prior training, work experience, and self-study into a focused dev journey.  
No job-hunting here — just documenting the process and enjoying the ride.

## 🧠 Background Timeline

- 📚 **2015–2016** — Software & Web Dev (VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, Java, SQL, UML)
- 🎮 **2019–2020** — First run at DAE (quit due to Covid ruining on-campus experience)
- 🛍️ **2018–2023** — Retail worker @ Kringloopwinkel Beveren-Leie
- 🔌 **2023–2025** — Telecom technician @ Telenet (HFC networks, routing, Wi-Fi, IP config)
- 🎓 **2025–Now** — Back at DAE — focused, determined, and not starting from zero

## 🎮 Game Dev Focus

**Current learning focus:**
- Modern C++ (C++17/20), clean architecture, TDD
- Animation math (vectors, matrices, transforms, kinematics)
- Game systems thinking & reusability
- Low-level engine-friendly code

**Side tools:**
- Blender (hard surface modeling, UV unwrapping, basic texturing)
- GitHub Copilot & ChatGPT (code assistant, not autopilot)
- Markdown, Doxygen, Catch2
- Audio hobbyist: FL Studio + NI Komplete 14 CE

## 📌 Guiding Principles

- ✅ Clean, testable code > quick hacks  
- 📚 Clear documentation > assumptions  
- 🧩 Systems > scripts  
- 🧠 Understanding > memorization  
- 🤖 AI-assisted, not AI-dependent  
- 🚫 I don’t ship vibes, I ship working code
