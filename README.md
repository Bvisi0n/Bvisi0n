# 👋 About Me

I’m a **Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE)** student at Howest (Belgium),
specializing in **C++ game programming** with a focus on **game engine architecture and clean systems**.

I enjoy breaking complex problems into reusable libraries and building solid foundations that future games can rely on.

> 🦍 **Fun fact:** I was born on **September 8, 1992** —  
> the same day *Donkey Kong Country* launched in Japan.  
> It’s also **World Great Ape Day**, and my Chinese Zodiac sign is **Monkey**.

Some call that coincidence.  
I call it good instincts: I like my branches clean and my code structured.

## 🧠 Background Timeline

* 📚 **2015–2016** — Software & Web Dev (VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, Java, SQL, UML)
* 🎮 **2019–2020** — First run at DAE (quit due to Covid ruining on-campus experience)
* 🛍️ **2018–2023** — Retail worker @ Kringloopwinkel Beveren-Leie
* 🔌 **2023–2025** — Telecom technician @ Telenet (HFC networks, routing, Wi-Fi, IP config)
* 🎓 **2025–Now** — Back at DAE — stronger, wiser, and banana-powered

## 🎮 Game Dev Focus

**Current learning focus:**

* Modern C++ (C++17/20), clean architecture, TDD
* Animation math (vectors, matrices, transforms, kinematics)
* Game systems thinking & reusability
* Low-level engine-friendly code (less spaghetti, more banana-optimized C++)

**Side tools:**

* Blender (hard surface modeling, UV unwrapping, basic texturing)
* GitHub Copilot & ChatGPT (code assistant, not jungle guide)
* Markdown, Doxygen, Catch2
* Audio hobbyist: FL Studio + NI Komplete 14 CE *(beats optional — groove mandatory)*

## 📌 Guiding Principles

* ✅ Clean, testable code > quick hacks
* 📚 Clear documentation > assumptions
* 🧩 Systems > scripts
* 🧠 Understanding > memorization
* 🤖 AI-assisted, not AI-dependent
* 🚫 I don’t ship vibes, I ship working code
* 🍌 Good commits. Strong branches. Big brain.

## 🤖 AI & Workflow Philosophy

I hail from the pre-AI era — back when code was carved in stone and bugs were hunted manually through the tall grass.  
Now? I've trained with the tools. I prompt with purpose. I wield AI like a sharpened stick.

Suddenly, I can generate edge-case test suites, shape Doxygen in-house style, and restructure modules —  
not in hours, but in minutes.  
The jungle didn’t get easier. **I just got stronger.**

> AI doesn't replace expertise. It amplifies it — or exposes the lack of it.
> *I used to sweat for hours to find the bug.
> Now I sweat for seconds — to make sure Copilot didn’t leave a banana peel.*

## 🧪 Bonus Gist Workflow

Some of my utility functions live temporarily as GitHub Gists.
Think of them as **baby chimps** — wild, untamed, and waiting to be adopted into a real library.

Check my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/Bvisi0n) for experiments, math bits, and early engine glue.

Thanks for visiting my corner of GitHub.  
Remember: **real devs swing through branches, not burn them.**  
And if your code smells like bananas… that just means I’ve already been through there.
