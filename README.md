# 👋 About Me

I’m a **Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE)** student at Howest (Belgium),
specializing in **C++ game programming** with a focus on **game engine architecture and clean systems**.

I enjoy breaking complex problems into reusable libraries and building solid foundations that future games can rely on.

> 🦍 **Fun fact:** I was born on **September 8, 1992** —  
> the same day *Donkey Kong Country* launched in Japan.  
> It’s also **World Great Ape Day**, and my Chinese Zodiac sign is **Monkey**.

Some call that coincidence.  
I call it good instincts: I like my branches clean and my code structured.

## 🤖 AI & Workflow Philosophy

I hail from the pre-AI era — back when code was carved in stone and bugs were hunted manually through the tall grass.  
Now? I've trained with the tools. I prompt with purpose. I wield AI like a sharpened stick.

Suddenly, I can generate edge-case test suites, shape Doxygen in-house style, and restructure modules —  
not in hours, but in minutes.  
The jungle didn’t get easier. **I just got stronger.**

> AI doesn't replace expertise. It amplifies it — or exposes the lack of it.
> *I used to sweat for hours to find the bug.
> Now I sweat for seconds — to make sure ChatGPT didn’t leave a banana peel.*

## 🧪 Bonus Gist Workflow

Some of my early experiments and utility functions live as GitHub Gists —  
still a bit wild, a bit primal, waiting to be adopted into a proper library.

Check my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/Bvisi0n) for math bits, engine glue, and small prototypes.

Thanks for visiting my corner of GitHub.  
Remember: **real devs swing through branches, not burn them.**  
And if your code smells like bananas… that just means I’ve already been through there.
