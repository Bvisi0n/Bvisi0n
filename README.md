# 👋 About Me

I’m a **Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE)** student at Howest (Belgium),
specializing in **C++ game programming** with a focus on **game engine architecture and clean systems**.

I enjoy breaking complex problems into reusable libraries and building solid foundations that future games can rely on.

> 🦍 **Fun fact:** I was born on **September 8, 1992** —  
> the same day *Donkey Kong Country* launched in Japan.  
> It’s also **World Great Ape Day**, and my Chinese Zodiac sign is **Monkey**.

Some call that coincidence.  
I call it good instincts: I like my branches clean and my code structured.

## 🤖 AI & Workflow Philosophy

I hail from the pre-AI era — back when code was carved in stone and bugs were hunted manually through the tall grass.  
Now? I've trained with the tools. I prompt with purpose. I wield AI like a sharpened stick.

Suddenly, I can generate edge-case test suites, shape Doxygen in-house style, and restructure modules —  
not in hours, but in minutes.  
The jungle didn’t get easier. **I just got stronger.**

> AI doesn't replace expertise. It amplifies it — or exposes the lack of it.
> *I used to sweat for hours to find the bug.
> Now I sweat for seconds — to make sure ChatGPT didn’t leave a banana peel.*

## 🧭 Connected Worlds

My creations roam freely across multiple domains — each one a branch of the same jungle:

🕹️ [itch.io](https://bvisi0n.itch.io) — Game jam entries, playable builds, and prototypes  
🎧 [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/Bvisi0n/) — SFX, ambient loops, and raw audio experiments  
🎼 [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jaro-de-graeve) — OST ideas, sketches, and moody project tracks  
💻 [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/Bvisi0n) — Math tricks, systems glue, and bite-sized tools

Thanks for visiting my corner of GitHub.  
These branches are where I grow my systems — feel free to swing by anytime.
